        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I believe that time is the most precious resource we have to manage. I don't miss an opportunity to increase my technical skills, and adjust organizational skills, in order to finalize tasks efficiently. I enjoy being in a challenging environment, in which I can engage my professionalism and keep on developing my growth. Main interest when not coding is travelling with my family, and spending time in activities that can enrich my background.</p>
